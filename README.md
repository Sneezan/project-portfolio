# [OLD PORTFOLIO, NOT IN USE] Cecilia Fr√•nlund Portfolio
This is the old portfolio, built in HTML and CSS only. This 
portfolio is not used and is discarded for the newer improved portfolio
that was built using react, it can be found here: https://github.com/Sneezan/project-react-portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, containing the latest projects I've been working on
and is updated weekly. 

The portfolio is created from a set design that had to be followed. I used
a darker color scheme than suggested, the portfolio is validated through
accessibility tools, has aria labels and is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop 
programmed in a mobile-first approach.
